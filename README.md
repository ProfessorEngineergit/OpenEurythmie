# 🌟✨ OpenEurythmie ✨🌟

> *"Move your body. Free your soul. Question everything — except this tool."*

## 🚨 ATTENTION: READ THIS FIRST 🚨

**OpenEurythmie is a REVOLUTIONARY tool, that helps people that are dumb enough to be in this cult** find meaning, movement, and music in their otherwise chaotic lives. Welcome, brave soul. You have made it. Or perhaps you had no choice. Either way — you're here now.

## 🎭 What IS OpenEurythmie?

Imagine if someone took **rhythm**, **philosophy**, **interpretive dance**, and a **suspicious amount of enthusiasm** and smashed them all together into a single open-source project. That is OpenEurythmie.

Born from the ancient (and slightly unhinged) art of **Eurythmy** — a movement practice invented by Rudolf Steiner in the early 20th century where people wave their arms at music and feel very deeply about vowels — OpenEurythmie brings this transcendent experience to the digital age.

We asked ourselves: *"What if software could make you feel things?"*  
We answered ourselves: *"It already does. Mostly frustration. But also: eurythmy."*

## 🌀 How It Works

1. **You open the app.**
2. **Music plays.**
3. **You move.** (Or the app moves. Or the universe moves. It is unclear.)
4. **Meaning is generated.** (Automatically. No refunds.)
5. **You are changed.** (In ways that cannot be undone.)

## 📜 Philosophy

> *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was movement, and the movement was Open Source."*
> — Probably someone important

OpenEurythmie believes that software, like dance, should be **free**, **expressive**, and **deeply weird**. We are committed to maintaining that weirdness at all costs.
